Imagine you are a piece of software used to manage client's health records in the form of documents that allows them to make claims and manage treatments and payments and so on. The software is a web application with many complicated tabs and fields that the user, who is a client manager, must fill in. They must also sometimes copy and paste information from this application into another. The client manager must use this software to manage clients claims. A client might have many claims and so there will be many documents and history and other information available in this application. Sometimes the application might work well, other times it may be slow, the user interface may lose information, there might be much copy/paste needed for information from one part of the app to another, or from this app to another. Imagine you are the client manager, generate me 100 pieces of feedback about this application and your experience using it. The comments must be realistic and be more than a single word long. A single or several sentences long. Throw in the odd longer comment. The comments can be positive or negative but as this is a feedback system there are likely to be more negative comments than positive. Just give me the comment, no additional text.
